First, we divided the web project into efficient components to ensure modularity and maintainability. We then set up the project using React.

Our primary focus was on implementing the core features of the web application. This included developing the home page, creating a robust video player component for seamless video playback, and building an upload screen for new videos. We ensured that user data on the home page could be dynamically updated and displayed efficiently.

The video player component was designed to provide smooth playback with controls like play, pause, and seek functionality.

On the home page, we focused on displaying user-specific content and making sure that user data could be easily updated. Additionally, we added a search functionality accessible via a search bar at the top left of the screen for quick and easy access.

During development, we emphasized creating a stable and reliable application by dividing the project into components efficiently and adhering to best practices in web development. This approach allowed us to maintain high performance and scalability.
