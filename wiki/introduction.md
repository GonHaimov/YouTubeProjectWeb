Welcome to our YouTube App in Advanced Programming Project!
This course took place in our 2nd year of Computer Science at Bar-Ilan University, and we completed this project throughout the first semester.

Our task was to build a YouTube-like app, both for web and Android. For the web part, we used React, Node.js, CSS, HTML, and C++, and for the Android part, we used Android Studio. We implemented a server-side backend that interacts with a local MongoDB database to manage users, videos, and comments efficiently across the platforms.

Project Phases:
Developing the Web App and Connecting It to the Server:

We built the YouTube-like web app using React for the frontend and connected it to a Node.js backend server. We implemented CRUD operations for videos, comments, and user profiles, using MongoDB as our database. Connecting the Android App to the Server:

After building the Android app in Android Studio, we linked it to the same Node.js server, enabling full functionality such as user login, video uploads, and video streaming. Building and Integrating the TCP Server:

Finally, we built a TCP server to synchronize data across the Bloom Filter, Node.js server, React web app, and Android app, ensuring consistent data management across platforms.
